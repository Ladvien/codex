### TICKET-005: Fix N+1 Query Patterns in Hybrid Search
**Type:** Performance  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Database, Search  
**Story Points:** 5  

**Description:**
Hybrid search executes individual queries per result instead of batch fetching, causing severe performance degradation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Single batch query for all search results
- [ ] JOIN operations replace iterative fetches
- [ ] Query plan optimized with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Response time <100ms for 100 results
- [ ] Database round trips reduced by 90%

**Definition of Done:**
- N+1 queries eliminated in all search paths
- Performance tests show 10x improvement
- Database monitoring confirms reduced load
- Query execution plans reviewed by DBA
- No functional regressions

### TICKET-006: Implement Forgetting Mechanisms
**Type:** Feature  
**Priority:** High  
**Component:** Memory Management  
**Story Points:** 13  

**Description:**
System lacks forgetting curves and memory decay, leading to unbounded memory growth and exhaustion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Ebbinghaus forgetting curve implemented
- [ ] Configurable decay rates per memory tier
- [ ] Automatic cleanup of decayed memories
- [ ] Reinforcement learning updates decay rate
- [ ] Memory importance scoring affects decay
- [ ] Batch cleanup job runs hourly

**Definition of Done:**
- Forgetting mechanism active in production
- Memory growth rate stabilized
- Long-term storage costs projected and acceptable
- A/B test shows improved retrieval relevance
- Documentation includes decay configuration guide

## P2 - Medium Priority Issues

### TICKET-007: Fix Layer Boundary Violations
**Type:** Technical Debt  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Component:** Architecture  
**Story Points:** 8  

**Description:**
Direct database access from service layer violates clean architecture principles, reducing maintainability.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Repository pattern consistently implemented
- [ ] No direct SQL in service layer
- [ ] Domain models separate from database entities
- [ ] Dependency injection for all repositories
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] No circular dependencies

**Definition of Done:**
- Architecture linting rules pass
- Dependency graph shows clean layers
- Code review by architecture team
- Documentation updated with layer responsibilities
- No performance regression
