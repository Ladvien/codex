**Stored in Codex Memory - Architecture Category - Importance: 10/10**

## Executive Overview

The **Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Agentic Literature Review System** is a sophisticated AWS serverless application that automates systematic literature reviews using AI agents powered by Amazon Bedrock (Claude models). This system implements the established 7-step OHAT methodology through individual Lambda functions orchestrated via API Gateway and managed through comprehensive state persistence.

## Architecture Summary

### Core Design Philosophy
- **Serverless-First**: Complete serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3
- **Agent-Based Processing**: Each OHAT step implemented as an independent Lambda function inheriting from `BaseOHATAgent`
- **Event-Driven Workflow**: Asynchronous processing with state management and cross-agent coordination
- **Cost-Optimized**: Function-specific memory allocation and Claude Haiku model selection for 95% cost reduction
- **Scientific Rigor**: Implements established OHAT methodology with confidence scoring and human review triggers

### Technology Stack
- **Infrastructure**: AWS SAM CloudFormation template with environment-specific deployment
- **Runtime**: Python 3.11 with Poetry dependency management
- **AI Integration**: Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for document analysis and synthesis
- **Storage**: S3 for documents/outputs, DynamoDB for state management
- **API Layer**: API Gateway REST API with configurable authentication and rate limiting
- **Development**: Comprehensive local development environment with hot-reload capabilities

## Infrastructure Components

### Lambda Functions (7 OHAT Steps)
1. **Input Validator** (256MB, 30s) - PECO criteria validation and document pre-processing
2. **Screening Agent** (1024MB, 300s) - Literature inclusion/exclusion based on PECO criteria
3. **Extraction Agent** (2048MB, 300s) - Structured data extraction from studies
4. **Bias Assessment Agent** (1024MB, 300s) - Risk of bias evaluation using OHAT framework
5. **Synthesis Agent** (2048MB, 300s) - Evidence synthesis across studies with Athena integration
6. **Translation Agent** (1024MB, 300s) - Evidence translation to confidence ratings
7. **Integration Agent** (1024MB, 300s) - Final hazard classification and integration

### Data Architecture
- **S3 Buckets**: 
  - Documents storage with versioning
