# ADR-004: Rust Async Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The memory system requires high performance, safety, and concurrency. We evaluated several language options including Python, Go, TypeScript, and Rust for the core implementation.

## Decision
Implement the memory system in Rust using async/await patterns with Tokio runtime.

Architecture choices:
- Tokio for async runtime and I/O operations
- sqlx for database operations with compile-time query verification
- axum for HTTP server implementation
- Arc/RwLock for shared state management
- Channel-based communication for background tasks

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Memory safety without garbage collection overhead
- Excellent performance for CPU and I/O intensive operations
- Strong type system prevents many runtime errors
- Zero-cost abstractions enable high-level code without performance penalty
- Excellent concurrency model with async/await

**Negative:**
- Steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Rust
- Longer compilation times compared to interpreted languages
- Limited ecosystem compared to more mature languages

**Risks:**
- Developer productivity may be lower initially
- Hiring may be more challenging due to smaller Rust talent pool
