## HIGH-004: Optimize Database Connection Pool Configuration

**Story Type:** Performance  
**Priority:** High  
**Components:** Database Layer, Configuration  
**Estimated Points:** 3  

### Description
Current connection pool configuration (10 connections) is severely undersized for >1000 ops/sec throughput requirement. PostgreSQL memory settings are also inadequate for vector operations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Connection pool size increased to minimum 100 connections
- [ ] PgBouncer configuration supports 2000 client connections
- [ ] PostgreSQL memory settings updated:
  - [ ] shared_buffers set to 8GB (25-40% of available RAM)
  - [ ] effective_cache_size set to 24GB (50-75% of RAM)
  - [ ] maintenance_work_mem set to 2GB for vector index builds
  - [ ] work_mem set to 256MB for vector operations
- [ ] Connection pool properly handles connection recycling
- [ ] Timeout settings prevent connection exhaustion
- [ ] Load testing confirms >1000 ops/sec throughput
- [ ] No connection pool exhaustion under peak load
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for pool saturation
- [ ] Documentation includes tuning guidelines

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes pass all unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Database migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet specified latency targets
- [ ] Code review completed by at least two team members
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Changes deployed to development environment successfully

## MEDIUM-001: Integrate Reflection Generator Service

**Story Type:** Feature  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Components:** Cognitive Processing Layer  
**Estimated Points:** 5  

### Description
Reflection Generator exists in codebase but isn't integrated into the main cognitive processing pipeline. This component should be creating meta-memories and generating insights from existing memories.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Reflection Generator integrated into main processing pipeline
- [ ] Service runs as background process at configurable intervals
- [ ] Meta-memories created based on pattern detection
- [ ] Insights table populated with generated insights
- [ ] Importance multiplier (1.5x) applied to insight-based memories
- [ ] Integration with existing memory scoring system
- [ ] Configurable thresholds for insight generation
- [ ] Performance impact <100ms for reflection operations
- [ ] Metrics exposed for insight generation rate
- [ ] Documentation includes reflection patterns guide

- Memory consolidation patterns

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes pass all unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Database migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet specified latency targets
- [ ] Code review completed by at least two team members
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Changes deployed to development environment successfully

## MEDIUM-002: Create Missing Database Tables

**Story Type:** Feature  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Components:** Database Layer  
**Estimated Points:** 3  

### Description
Several tables specified in architecture are missing from database schema: insights, harvest_sessions, consolidation_log, and knowledge graph tables.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] harvest_sessions table created with proper schema
- [ ] insights table created with relationship to source memories
- [ ] consolidation_log table tracks all tier migrations
- [ ] Knowledge graph tables support relationship storage
- [ ] All tables have appropriate indexes for query performance
- [ ] Foreign key relationships properly established
- [ ] Migration scripts handle table creation safely
- [ ] Sample data validates table structures
- [ ] Integration with existing repository methods
- [ ] Documentation includes table relationship diagram

- Architecture Document: Database Schema (Section 3.3)
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Data model specifications

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes pass all unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Database migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet specified latency targets
- [ ] Code review completed by at least two team members
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Changes deployed to development environment successfully

## MEDIUM-003: Fix Layer Architecture Violations

**Story Type:** Technical Debt  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Components:** All Layers  
**Estimated Points:** 13  

### Description
Multiple components are violating layer boundaries by directly accessing lower layers instead of using proper abstractions. This creates tight coupling and maintenance issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main.rs no longer contains business logic implementations
- [ ] All MCP operations routed through MCP layer handlers
- [ ] Backup module uses repository abstraction instead of direct PgPool
- [ ] Monitoring health checks use repository methods, not raw SQL
- [ ] Security modules access data through proper interfaces
- [ ] SemanticDeduplicationEngine uses repository, not direct database
- [ ] API layer routes through MCP protocol layer
- [ ] No modules skip their adjacent layer
- [ ] Dependency injection used for layer connections
- [ ] Clear interfaces defined between all layers

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code changes pass all unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Database migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet specified latency targets
- [ ] Code review completed by at least two team members
