# ADR-005: Security Authentication Model

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The memory system handles sensitive user data and requires robust security measures. We needed to balance security, usability, and performance while supporting multiple authentication methods.

## Decision
Implement a multi-layered security architecture with:

1. **Multiple Authentication Methods**:
   - API keys for service-to-service communication
   - JWT tokens for user sessions
   - Certificate-based authentication for high-security environments

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Per-client, per-tool, and global rate limits
   - Configurable thresholds with whitelist support
   - Silent mode support for background operations

3. **Input Validation**:
   - SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
   - XSS protection and input sanitization
   - Content validation and size limits

4. **Audit and Compliance**:
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - PII detection and masking
   - RBAC for fine-grained access control

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Defense-in-depth security model
- Flexible authentication supports various deployment scenarios  
- Performance target <5ms for auth operations achieved
- Comprehensive audit trail for compliance

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in configuration and deployment
- Additional overhead for security processing
- Need for secret management and rotation

**Risks:**
- Configuration errors could create security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation if rate limits are too aggressive
