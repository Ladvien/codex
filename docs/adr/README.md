# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Codex Memory System. Each ADR documents significant architectural decisions made during the development of the system.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows the standard format:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?
- **Decision**: What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?
