[10:58] | rust-engineering-expert | HIGH | /Users/ladvien/codex/src/main.rs:224
Issue: Using unwrap_or_else with Config::default() instead of proper error handling
Fix: Replace with proper Result<T, E> error handling and propagate errors. Pattern: `config.unwrap_or_else(|_| { ... Config::default() })` masks configuration errors that should be surfaced to users.
Related: Lines 335, 404 have similar patterns

[10:58] | rust-engineering-expert | MEDIUM | /Users/ladvien/codex/src/main.rs:269
Issue: Discarding Result value with underscore assignment: `let _ = setup_manager.quick_health_check().await;`
Fix: Handle the Result properly with match or if-let pattern, or use .unwrap_or_log() pattern for proper error logging
Related: Error handling pattern inconsistent throughout file

[10:58] | rust-engineering-expert | HIGH | /Users/ladvien/codex/src/main.rs:308-310

Fix: Use .take(200).collect::<String>() directly or implement a truncate method to avoid repeated allocation
Related: Performance impact in memory search results formatting

[10:58] | rust-engineering-expert | CRITICAL | /Users/ladvien/codex/src/main.rs:700-1189
Issue: Extremely large function (490 lines) - start_mcp_stdio violates single responsibility principle
Fix: Break down into smaller functions: parse_request, handle_tool_call, format_response, etc. Current function handles JSON-RPC parsing, validation, embedding, database ops, and response formatting.
Related: Maintainability and testing nightmare - impossible to unit test individual parts

[10:59] | rust-engineering-expert | HIGH | /Users/ladvien/codex/src/main.rs:744-746
