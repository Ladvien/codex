I'll convert these issues into detailed Jira stories organized by priority. Each ticket includes acceptance criteria, minimal code examples where necessary, and definition of done.

## P0 - Critical Issues (Production Blockers)



## P1 - High Priority Issues




## P2 - Medium Priority Issues

## P3 - Low Priority Issues

## Epic: Migration Scripts



Each ticket is now ready for sprint planning with clear scope, acceptance criteria, and definition of done. The team can prioritize P0 tickets for immediate remediation before production deployment.
