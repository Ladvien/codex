# ADR-001: Memory Tier Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The system needs to efficiently manage memory storage with different access patterns and retention requirements. We needed to balance performance, cost, and cognitive principles to create an effective memory hierarchy.

## Decision
We implement a 4-tier memory architecture:

1. **Working Memory** - Hot, frequently accessed memories (Miller's 7Â±2 limit)
2. **Warm Memory** - Recently accessed but not critical for immediate recall  
3. **Cold Memory** - Long-term storage with lower access frequency
4. **Frozen Memory** - Archived memories with minimal access

The system uses:
- Automated tier migration based on access patterns and importance scores
- Forgetting curves inspired by Ebbinghaus research
- Consolidation strength calculations for memory retention
- Batch processing for efficient tier migrations

## Consequences
**Positive:**
- Optimal performance for frequently accessed memories
- Cost-effective storage for long-term retention
- Psychologically-inspired design mimics human memory
- Scalable architecture supports millions of memories

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in memory management logic
- Need for monitoring and tuning of tier thresholds
- Migration overhead during tier transitions

**Risks:**
- Incorrect tier placement could impact performance
- Need careful tuning of forgetting parameters
